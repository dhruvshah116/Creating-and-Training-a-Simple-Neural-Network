A Neural Network with no Hidden Layers is called a Perceptron.

Synapses are a connection between input and a Neuron. Each synapse is initialised with a weight. Weights are very important to get accurate output.

To understand what happens in a neuron , we need a little math :
A neuron basically gets an output by doing a weighted sum on the inputs.

We'll use our sigmoid function as the normalizing function to build the basic form of perceptron in python.
