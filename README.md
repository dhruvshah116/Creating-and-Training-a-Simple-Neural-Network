# Creating-and-Training-a-Simple-Neural-Network

A Neural Network with no Hidden Layers is called a Perceptron.

Synapses are a connection between input and a Neuron. Each synapse is initialised with a weight. Weights are very important to get accurate output.

To understand what happend in a neuron , we need a little math :
A neuron basically gets an output by doing a weighted sum on the inputs
